# GM Quality of Life Library
Hi there! Welcome to the official developers' repository for the GameMaker Quality of Life Library! All of the source code for builds of GM QOL are pushed here.

- Visit the website: [Main Site](https://sites.google.com/view/gm-qol/home)
- Read the documentation here: [QOL Documentation](https://sites.google.com/view/gm-qol-docs/home)

For the latest builds of the GM QOL Library, click on the **Releases** section on the right-hand side of the page! The releases you find there will be the most stable releases of the library.

A brief overview of some of the features of the library:
- Turns long-named functions into short-named functions; for example, you can use `print()` for printing debug messages into the Output window as opposed to `show_debug_message()`
- Adds non-built-in functions that are heavily used all around the GameMaker community!
- Has fully implemented and detailed JSDoc formatting in place for those of you who use Feather!
- Adds a large suite of debugging tools, such as writing debug log files, and even an entire slash command prompt to debug your games with. You can also expand upon the built-in command prompt to include commands of your own to tailor the command prompt to your needs!
- And many more features!
